TwitchChatBot
==========

A nice simple IRC bot for Twitch written fully in C++ on stream. Something that
be used for learning, playing, and adding to as well as whatever we make it to
in this stream series.

Some portions of the class have been left purposely incomplete for users to
fill in if they so choose.

Twitch?

Yeah, they have a programming section and everything, so I figured I'd lend
some knowledge to programming broadcasts that take the form of a video
tutorial. In the broadcasts I go through what I am creating, why I am making
the decisions I am (and programming the items in a given way) as well as some
of the common pit falls that people just starting out run in to.

If you are interested in viewing a broadcast at some point, feel free to drop
